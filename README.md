# ApiHttpClient
A (very sparse) Simple Rest Sharp Wrapper for use in my own projects that will expand over time as usage requires which allows for testing

# Target Frameworks
 .Net Standard (so should be usable in both .Net Full and .Net Core frameworks)
 
# Usage
Well don't (well at least not yet lol).

1. Add a reference to ApiHttpClient
2. Create an ApiConfig object
3. Instanciate either ApiHttpClient or ApiHttpClientAsync
4. Make use of the (currently only) one method Get<T>...
